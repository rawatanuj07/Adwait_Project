# <span style="font-size: 2em;"> üöÄ Hi there! Welcome to my Next.js project! </span>


- ‚ö°Ô∏è My name is Anuj Rawat. I used create-next-app to bootstrap this project and get started quickly.

To get started, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

You will need Node.js and npm on your machine.

## Setup

Get the code by cloning this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/rawatanuj07/Adwait_Project
```

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```



Run this command to start the development server.

```
npm run dev
```


Now open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.



The main page of the application is located in pages/page.tsx in the root directory. To navigate to the components used in the page, go to the components folder.

Thanks for checking out my Next.js project!
